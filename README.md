### Database Validation

To have your data checked by a global system of information about biodiversity ( <a href="https://www.gbif.org/" target="_blank">GBIF</a> ), start the verification by selecting the correct card.

> In this section, will be asked for you to fill the fields correctly to identify the columns in your spreadsheet file.

![gbif-form](files/images/pt2.gif)

> Then your spreadsheet will be available, now you can check the suggestions and save the changes if you like

### Geographical Validation

To validate your data for `latitude` and `longitude`, this section lets you check if you typed the right coordinates by showing in the map every entry.

> The first step is to select the correct card.

![map-route](files/images/map-pt1.gif)

> Select the corresponding columns in your spreadsheet file.

![map-spreadsheet](files/images/map-pt2.gif)

> Then you will be redirected to plot markers and identify the area you collected the data.

![map-markers](files/images/map-pt3.gif)

> After saving your coordinates, the map will show which entries have the correct `latitude` and `longitude` according to your spreadsheet file and the polygon you drew.

> Together with a list containing suggestions for possible incorrect entries.

> Validations will be availible at this point for modify the data in your spreadsheet file and save changes if you like.

### Comparison between Spreadsheets

This section will ask for you to fill the fields correctly to identify the columns for `two` spreadsheet files.

> Insert the file that will be used as reference.

![localsheet-reference](files/images/localsheet-pt1.gif)

> Identify the columns in both files.

![localsheet-form](files/images/localsheet-pt2.gif)

> After the software identify your columns, the data will be compared the entries between them.
